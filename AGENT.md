# Agent Rules

These rules govern the development of the Aion project.

## Rules
- **Dependency Cleanliness:** Maintain clean package dependencies. Resolve peer dependency conflicts by aligning versions in `package.json` rather than relying on `--legacy-peer-deps` or `--force`.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** Keep cross-platform requirements in mind. The app runs on Expo (iOS, Android, Web) and Tauri (macOS, Windows, Linux).
- **Linter & Formatter:** Ensure ESLint runs cleanly on `app/`, `components/`, and `lib/` directories. Use prettier for formatting.

## Change Log

### 2026-05-21 (Australia/Sydney)
**Raouf:**
- **Scope:** Backend IDOR Security Fix
- **Summary:** Performed a backend security audit and fixed an Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability in the chat Supabase Edge Function (`supabase/functions/chat/index.ts`). The function now validates the UUID format of incoming `conversation_id` and verifies that the authenticated user owns the conversation before updating it or inserting new messages, preventing users from altering others' conversations.
- **Files Changed:**
  - [supabase/functions/chat/index.ts](file:///Users/raoof.r12/Desktop/Raouf/Aion/supabase/functions/chat/index.ts) - Added UUID format validation and ownership checks before conversation database updates and message inserts.
- **Verification:** Ran `deno check supabase/functions/chat/index.ts`, `npm run lint`, `npm run format`, and `npm run type-check`, all completing with 0 errors.
- **Follow-ups:** None.

### 2026-05-21 (Australia/Sydney)
**Raouf:**
- **Scope:** Syntax Fix & Supabase Resilience
- **Summary:** Fixed a syntax error in the chapter reader screen by removing a duplicate closing parenthesis and semicolon. Additionally, made the Supabase client instantiation resilient by providing fallback values and console warnings when environment variables are missing, preventing import-time app crashes.
- **Files Changed:**
  - [app/reader/[bookId]/[chapter].tsx](file:///Users/raoof.r12/Desktop/Raouf/Aion/app/reader/%5BbookId%5D/%5Bchapter%5D.tsx) - Removed duplicate closing parenthesis and semicolon.
  - [lib/supabase.ts](file:///Users/raoof.r12/Desktop/Raouf/Aion/lib/supabase.ts) - Added fallback environment variable values and warning.
- **Verification:** Ran `npm run lint`, `npm run format`, and `npm run type-check`, all of which completed with 0 errors.
- **Follow-ups:** None.

### 2026-05-21 (Australia/Sydney)
**Raouf:**
- **Scope:** Dependency Upgrades
- **Summary:** Upgraded non-Expo dependencies to their latest compatible versions, aligned Expo modules with Expo SDK 54 recommended versions via `npx expo install --fix`, and pinned `react-dom` to `19.1.0` to resolve a peer dependency conflict with `react@19.1.0` required by `react-native`.
- **Files Changed:**
  - [package.json](file:///Users/raoof.r12/Desktop/Raouf/Aion/package.json) - Upgraded dependencies/devDependencies and pinned `react-dom` to `19.1.0`.
- **Verification:** Ran `npm install` and verified all packages resolved cleanly with 0 vulnerabilities. Ran `npm run lint` and verified linter output is error-free.
- **Follow-ups:** None.

### 2026-05-21 (Australia/Sydney)
**Raouf:**
- **Scope:** Dependency Security Vulnerabilities
- **Summary:** Resolved npm audit security vulnerabilities (XSS in postcss and ReDoS in markdown-it) by configuring npm overrides.
- **Files Changed:**
  - [package.json](file:///Users/raoof.r12/Desktop/Raouf/Aion/package.json) - Added overrides for `postcss` (`^8.5.15`) and `markdown-it` (`^14.1.1`).
- **Verification:** Ran `npm install` and verified `npm audit` reports 0 vulnerabilities. Verified `npm run lint` still runs successfully with 0 errors.
- **Follow-ups:** None.

### 2026-05-21 (Australia/Sydney)
**Raouf:**
- **Scope:** ESLint Dependency Conflict
- **Summary:** Resolved `npm install` peer dependency conflict between `eslint` and `eslint-plugin-react` by downgrading `eslint` from `^10.1.0` to `^9.39.0`.
- **Files Changed:**
  - [package.json](file:///Users/raoof.r12/Desktop/Raouf/Aion/package.json) - Downgraded `eslint` dependency from `^10.1.0` to `^9.39.0`.
- **Verification:** Successfully ran `npm install` and verified that the package-lock resolved cleanly. Verified that `npm run lint` executes successfully with 0 errors.
- **Follow-ups:** None.
